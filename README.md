This repo builds a 2-AZ VPC with public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnets, an AutoScaling Group (ASG) launching instances into the private subnets (using a Launch Template), and the security groups & route tables required. The ALB serves traffic (HTTP/80) to the ASG. The terraform S3 backend stores the state remotely.
