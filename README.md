########  Project Overview

This project uses Terraform to automate the creation of a complete highly available web application infrastructure on AWS.
A VPC is set up with both public and private subnets across multiple availability zones.
A public-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic to an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of EC2 instances running inside the private subnets (so they are not exposed directly to the internet).
A NAT Gateway is provided in the public subnet to allow private instances to download updates/packages securely without needing public IPs.
Security Groups ensure controlled access: the ALB accepts HTTP traffic from the internet, and EC2 instances only accept traffic coming from the ALB.
Terraformâ€™s S3 backend stores the remote state, making it easier for teams to collaborate.
