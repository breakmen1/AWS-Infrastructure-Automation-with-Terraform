🚀 Terraform AWS VPC with ALB & ASG

This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable, highly available web application on AWS using Terraform.
It provisions a custom VPC, public & private subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of EC2 instances running Apache.

🌐 Project Overview
What This Project Does

This project automates the creation of a secure and production-ready web environment on AWS:

Custom VPC – Dedicated network for isolation.

Public Subnets – Host the ALB and internet-facing resources.

Private Subnets – Host EC2 instances (web servers) protected from direct internet access.

Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG) – Scales EC2 instances automatically based on demand.

EC2 Instances – Run Apache web server with a simple webpage.

Security Groups – Control inbound/outbound traffic securely.

🎯 Why This Project is Useful

Automation – Eliminates manual setup using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Scalability – Auto-scaling handles variable workloads automatically.

High Availability – Multi-AZ setup ensures fault tolerance.

Security – Private subnets + NAT Gateway ensure instances are not directly exposed.

⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

Terraform CLI (latest version)

AWS Account with proper IAM access

AWS CLI configured with credentials

S3 Bucket (for Terraform remote state)

AMI ID (update in ec2.tf if using a region other than us-east-1)

🧩 Code Structure
.
├── vpc.tf          # VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, NAT Gateway
├── ec2.tf          # ALB, Target Groups, ASG, Security Groups, EC2 Launch Template
├── userdata.sh     # Bootstraps EC2 instances with Apache web server

Key Highlights

vpc.tf → Defines VPC, Subnets, IGW, NAT, Route Tables.

ec2.tf → Defines ALB, Target Group, Listener, Launch Template, Auto Scaling Group.

userdata.sh → Installs Apache, starts service, and serves a simple webpage.

🚀 Deployment Steps

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-vpc-alb-asg.git
cd aws-vpc-alb-asg


Initialize Terraform

terraform init


Review the Plan

terraform plan


Apply Configuration

terraform apply


Type yes when prompted.

Get the ALB DNS Name

terraform output aws_dns_name

🌐 Final Output

A highly available web application accessible via the ALB DNS.

Example output:

aws_dns_name = "my-aws-lb-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"


Open this DNS in a browser → You’ll see an Apache welcome page.

Refreshing shows responses from different EC2 instances (via ALB load balancing).

📸 Demo Screenshot (Optional)

(Add a screenshot of the webpage served through ALB if you want)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Terraform – Infrastructure as Code

AWS VPC, Subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway – Networking

AWS ALB – Load Balancing

AWS Auto Scaling Group – Elastic scaling

EC2 + Apache – Web server

✅ Outcome

You now have a scalable, secure, fault-tolerant infrastructure on AWS — all built automatically using Terraform.
